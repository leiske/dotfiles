I love the plan and everything we've discussed and iterated on. Please write all of it to plan.md (and delete an existing one if found) in chronological order as a backlog with checkboxes. Each task should be small and isolated, but have output and not just reading code. Feel free to create a large backlog so it is specific enough for a new engineer to take over implementation immediately.
