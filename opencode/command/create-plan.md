description: Create plan document with detail

I love the plan and everything we've discussed and iterated on. 

Please write all of it to plan.md in chronological order as a backlog with checkboxes. Each task should be isolated and independently verifiable.

Feel free to create a large backlog so it is specific enough for a new engineer to take over implementation immediately.

Each step should have a clear definition of done and verification steps.
